Complex networks are structurally non-trivial and require a large set of
tools to analyze their characteristics. In this thesis, we implement standard statistical correlation and
covariance methods. In addition, we implement the data-driven methods, Dynamic Mode Decomposition (DMD), and Kernel
Dynamic Mode Decomposition (KDMD). These methods are grounded in Koopman Theory and give us a dynamical systems perspective into 
network development. With feature matrices built from snapshots of motif counts throughout a 
network's development, we 
characterize the local network structure. Using our data-driven methods, we identify DMD and KDMD modes. The DMD and KDMD
modes show low mode-error by the Rowley criterion, and are good approximations to the true Koopman modes.
