Complex networks exhibit non-trivial topological features which makes
characterizing them with tools of standard graph theory difficult. These
networks are found commonly across many fields including biology, physics,
economics, and sociology. The social network Twitter is one such complex 
network noted for its popularity and impact. A Twitter retweet network is simulated
via the Thij model which incorporates a preferential attachment mechanism,
as well as a unique superstar mechanism. We examine the structure of
the network as it evolves over time. The network's motifs, induced subgraphs
which appears frequently in the network, can be used to examine communal
structure and also affect future communal structure. We use the Barabási–Albert model
of preferential attachment as a benchmark to compare motif development. Finally
we extract the dynamic behavior of motif counts through the Koopman operator and the Dynamic
Mode Decomposition algorithim.
